# Benchmarching Applications - WindFlow version

This repository contains a collection of Data Stream Processing applications implemented using the [WindFlow](https://github.com/ParaGroup/WindFlow) library. WindFlow is a C++17 library for parallel stream processing on shared-memory architectures featuring multi-core CPUs and GPU devices. Further information on the usage and the operators provided by the WindFlow API can be found in the [official documentation](https://paragroup.github.io/WindFlow/).

Two more implementations of these applications have been provided using [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/) and [Apache Flink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/) frameworks. The code can be found respectively in the [storm-applications](https://github.com/alefais/storm-applications) repository and in the [flink-applications](https://github.com/alefais/flink-applications) repository.
